actionjson includes four projects

decodeJson - A very fast JSON decoder
Around 5-8x faster than as3corelib's JSON decoder

encodeJson - A very fast json encoder
Around 3x faster than as3corelib's JSON encoder

JsonDecoderAsync - An asynchronous JSON parser
Can parse JSON in chunks, making it great for parsing large objects over time
Still around 2x faster than as3corelib's JSON decoder

JsonEncoderAsync - An asynchronous JSON encoder
Encodes JSON in chunks, for large objects that need to be encoded over time
Sadly, about the same speed as as3corelib's JSON encoder
